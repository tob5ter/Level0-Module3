text: "\n\n# Introduction to Remainder\n\nThe remainder operator is represented as\
  \ the percent sign %. This just means the remainder after division. You may also\
  \ hear this be called modulo.\nA common use for remainder is to test if a number\
  \ is odd or even.\nTo do this test, you divide the number by 2.\nIf the remainder\
  \ is zero, the number is even, but if the remainder is one, the number is odd. In\
  \ code this would look like this:\n```\nint number = new Random().nextInt(100);\n\
  \ if (number % 2 == 0) {\n     System.out.println(\"number is even\");\n }\n else\
  \ {\n     System.out.println(\"number is odd\");\n }\n```\nAnother use for remainder\
  \ could be to track every 20 times a loop is executed, as follows:\n```\nfor (int\
  \ i=1; i<=1000; i++) {\n    // do some code\n    if (i % 20 == 0){\n        System.out.println(\"\
  20 more repeats completed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Eclipse Recipes\n\nFizzBuzz\n\
