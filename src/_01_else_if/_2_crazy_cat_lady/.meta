  # Crazy Cat Lady


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/crazyCatLady.jpg"/>


  ## Goal:


  Use if and else if statements to provide different responses to a user based on
  how they answer the question, "How many cats do you have?".


  ## Steps:


  1. Ask the user how many cats they have.

  2. Convert their answer into a number (int).

  3. If they have 3 or more cats, they might be a crazy cat lady.

  4. If they have less than 3 cats AND more than 0 cats, they are a cat lover.

  5. If they have 0 cats, maybe they have a different pet.
